            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Pablo Picasso's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1881</strong> - Born October 25, Málaga, Spain</li>
                <li><strong>1900</strong> - Picasso's training under his father began before 1890.</li>
                <li><strong>1901</strong> - Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year.</li>
                <li><strong>1917</strong> - In February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy.</li>
                <li><strong>1940s</strong> - During World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city.</li>
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Died on 8 April in Mougins, France</li>
